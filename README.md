# project-pinnacle -  An "Observability platform" that derives Data Insights for error detection and identification.

## Problem Statement
As an engineer, it takes a lot of time to detect, analyze, troubleshoot and report all production performance issues.

Analyzing performance issues involves pattern analysis and correlation of components across various application stack.
Most of the use cases have similar issue patterns and are found across different module components. For example: a slow performing DWRCall

The process of issue detection, identification and troubleshooting is:
- Resource intensive
- Repetitive.
- Manual process
- Time consuming.

This has direct impact on customer experience using the application.

## Idea Statement

Project Pinnacle - This initiative is to build a data observability platform that will focus on error detection and identification for the identified areas of performance patterns.
This will help us analyze the behavior pattern of all application components / services and how it scales over time for various production tenants and their configurations.

• Adaptive Alerting based on identified use-case across the application.
• The main goal for Adaptive Alerting is to help drive down the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

### End User Value

• Identify production issues before customer reports it.
• Bring down Mean Time to Detect (MTTD].

### Business Value

1. High ROI in terms on application availability and performance. 
2. Business Continuity.
3. Organizational right to build an Observability platform for all its services
