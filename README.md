# project-pinnacle

## Overview
This initiative is to build an BizX data observability platform that will focus on error detection and identification for the identified areas of performance patterns .

This will help us analyze the behavior pattern of various BizX modules and application components / services and how it scales over time for various production tenants and their configurations.
